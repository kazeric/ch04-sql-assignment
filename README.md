# SQL Practice

## Overview

This folder contains a series of SQL assignment queries (q1.sql through q14.sql) designed to practice fundamental SQL concepts including SELECT statements, JOINs, filtering, aggregations, and data manipulation.

## Queries Included

### Basic Queries

- **q1.sql** - Simple SELECT with WHERE clause (filtering data by location)
- **q2.sql** - JOIN operations across multiple tables (customers, sales, products)

### Intermediate Queries

- **q3.sql through q7.sql** - Various SQL operations including:
  - Aggregation functions
  - GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
  - Multiple JOIN types
  - Subqueries and derived tables

### Advanced Queries

- **q8.sql through q12.sql** - Complex queries covering:
  - Window functions
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
  - Advanced filtering and transformations

## Purpose

This assignment reinforces SQL skills learned in Week 2, focusing on:

- Data retrieval and filtering
- Joining tables to correlate data
- Aggregating and grouping results
- Writing efficient and readable queries

## How to Use

1. Open each SQL file in your preferred SQL IDE or editor
2. Execute the queries against your database
3. Review the results and verify they match expected outputs
4. Modify queries as needed for practice or testing

## Database Schema

The queries reference tables such as:

- `customers` - Customer information (customer_id, full_name, location)
- `products` - Product catalog (product_id, product_name, price)
- `sales` - Transaction records (customer_id, product_id)

## Notes

- Ensure your database is properly set up before running queries
- Some queries may require specific table structures or sample data
- Feel free to experiment and modify queries to deepen your understanding
